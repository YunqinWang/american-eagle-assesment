The project is a shopping app for both desktop view and mobile view.

## Final Product

The app supports several interactions.

        I used setTimeOut to mock the waiting in a real searching situation.</li>
    <li>Collapse and expand the nav bar </li>
    <li>Collapse and expand the footer </li>
</ul>
